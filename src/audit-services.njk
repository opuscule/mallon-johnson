						<h2>Broker-Dealers</h2>
						<p>Our goal is to correct compliance problems before the SEC, FINRA, state or another regulatory agency arrives. To this end, Dexter B. Johnson conducts broker-dealer examinations that provide comprehensive reviews of existing and new regulations implemented by these regulatory bodies, and can include reviews of the following areas:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Supervisory Controls</li>
							<li>Business Continuity Planning</li>
							<li>Email Retention Procedures</li>
							<li>Order Audit Trail System (OATS) Reporting</li>
							<li>Sales of New Products</li>
							<li>Use of Electronic Systems</li>
							<li>OSJ and Branch Office Supervision</li>
							<li>Municipal Transaction Reporting</li>
							<li>Best Execution Mark-Ups</li>
							<li>Continuing Education Requirements</li>
							<li>Supervision of Representatives Outside Activities</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Initially, to determine the extent of the review and cost, we meet with supervisory personnel, review the firm's Form B-D, past quarterly and annual filings, and written supervisory procedures. From there fees are determined on a per day basis, with a flat fee per day.</p>
